## üöÄ Projects

### üåê 1. Automated AWS Receipt Processing System
- **Description:** Built a serverless receipt processing system that extracts, stores, and emails data from uploaded receipts.
- How it Works:

User uploads a receipt image to Amazon S3

An S3 trigger invokes a Lambda function

Lambda calls Amazon Textract to extract text data from the receipt

Extracted data is structured and sent back to Lambda

Lambda stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB

Lambda also sends an email with the processed data via Amazon SES
- **AWS Services:** S3, Lambda, Textract, DynamoDB, SES
- **Skills Gained:** Event-driven serverless architecture, text extraction with Textract, working with structured data, email notifications using SES
