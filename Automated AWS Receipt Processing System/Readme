üßæ 4. Automated AWS Receipt Processing System
üìå Description:
This project is a serverless receipt processing system built entirely using AWS services. The system is designed to automatically process uploaded receipt images, extract relevant data using Amazon Textract, store the structured data in DynamoDB, and send an email notification using Amazon SES ‚Äî all without any manual intervention.
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of event-driven architecture using S3 triggers and AWS Lambda, and showcases how different AWS services can be integrated for real-world automation.

üîÅ How It Works:
1.	User Upload
A user uploads a receipt image (JPEG/PNG) to an Amazon S3 bucket.
2.	S3 Event Trigger
The upload triggers an AWS Lambda function via an S3 event notification.
3.	Data Extraction (Amazon Textract)
The Lambda function calls Amazon Textract, which uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text data from the uploaded receipt.
4.	Data Processing
Textract returns structured text data (like item names, prices, total amount, date, etc.), which the Lambda function parses and organizes.
5.	Data Storage (DynamoDB)
The parsed data is saved into an Amazon DynamoDB table, which serves as the system‚Äôs lightweight, scalable NoSQL database.
6.	Email Notification (Amazon SES)
Once the data is stored, the Lambda function sends a confirmation email with receipt details using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).

Lambda Function Responsibilities
‚úÖ lambda_handler(event, context)
‚Ä¢	Entrypoint for the Lambda function.
‚Ä¢	Retrieves file details from S3 event.
‚Ä¢	Validates file presence.
‚Ä¢	Orchestrates the full flow: Textract ‚Üí DynamoDB ‚Üí SES.
‚úÖ process_receipt_with_textract(bucket, key)
‚Ä¢	Calls Textract's AnalyzeExpense API.
‚Ä¢	Extracts fields like vendor, total amount, and date.
‚Ä¢	Parses line items like item name, quantity, and price.
‚úÖ store_receipt_in_dynamodb(receipt_data, bucket, key)
‚Ä¢	Connects to a DynamoDB table.
‚Ä¢	Stores a full receipt record with metadata and line items.
‚úÖ send_email_notification(receipt_data)
‚Ä¢	Constructs an HTML email with:
o	Vendor name
o	Receipt total
o	Itemized list
o	S3 URL
‚Ä¢	Sends it using Amazon SES.
